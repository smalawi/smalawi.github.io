				<p>Just when my calluses have gotten pretty good, I've gone two days without practicing. Did a lot of
					errands today and hopefully got ahead of enough of them to spread my time around a bit more for the
					rest of the week.</p><p>
					
					I need to reevaluate this space, I think. I definitely prefer this medium to keeping a paper journal
					&ndash; adding images and screwing with the formatting and avoiding confrontation with my own
					handwriting are all good things. But I think it's falling back into the same pitfalls too: days of
					nothing worth recording, having to take time out of every day to write, going through the motions of
					recording events without much thought or substance. Pivoting to a blog type thing would also make
					more sense for something public-facing. But what would I <i>blog</i> about? Have to strike a balance
					somehow.</p>
