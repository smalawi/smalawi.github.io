				<p>Today's my last day in Florida. I'm flying back to New York with Jenna (my sister) and her cat
					tomorrow. I'd meant to drop by the library to get a card (in order to stop leeching off of my dad's
					Kanopy access) but there was actual work to be done and the day slipped away. I stepped out for a
					walk around six, heading first for this grassy expanse at the edge of the property, a few leftover
					acres between the swamp and the single-family houses. It was weirdly quiet, as golden hours go -
					aside from the crickets, nothing to be heard, save for a grackle hiccuping hoarsely to itself
					somewhere in the woods. Occasionally a pale little moth would fly from my path, skittering over the
					grass, too tremulous to get more than an inch or two off the ground. I spent a little time under a
					big evergreen of some sort, checking the pinecones for seeds the birds and squirrels had missed.</p>
