				<p>Today's my last day in Florida. I'm flying back to New York with Jenna (my sister) and Gaius (her cat)
					tomorrow. I'd meant to drop by the library to get a card (in order to stop leeching off of my dad's
					Kanopy access) but there was actual work to be done and the day slipped away. I stepped out for a
					walk around six, heading first for this grassy expanse at the edge of the property, a few leftover
					acres between the swamp and the single-family houses. It was weirdly quiet, as golden hours go -
					aside from the crickets, nothing to be heard, save for a grackle hiccuping hoarsely to itself
					somewhere in the woods. Occasionally a pale little moth would fly from my path, skittering over the
					grass, too tremulous to get more than an inch or two off the ground. I spent a little time under a
					big evergreen of some sort, checking the pinecones for seeds the birds and squirrels had missed.</p>
			</ul>

				<p>Flight back was uneventful (thankfully). Seems that Gaius was pretty calm from arrival at the airport
					onwards. I dozed off to the third side of Exile on Main St., slept about 40 minutes, and spent my
					subsequent wakefulness listening to the whole thing. Part of me still wishes the album just consisted 
					of eighteen Rocks Offs, but I do like it. It's got soul - plasticky, but not in the Paul Whiteman
					sense.</p><p>
					
					I was relieved to find that after five weeks my apartment smelled of nothing at all, and that no
					critters had found the not-quite-hermetically sealed cereal box on the kitchen counter. Shower faucet
					still leaks. I feel like I should figure out a belated holiday gift for Atilla and Gabor before
					inquiring about having that fixed. The mailbox was full but not overstuffed, notwithstanding the two
					Raymond Chandler paperbacks (Tom Adams covers) I'd ordered. <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i> should be
					coming during the week. After that, the remaining ones are expensive, less well-reputed, or downright
					impossible to find (<i>The Long Goodbye</i>, unfortunately).</p><p>
					
					After unpacking (ten minutes) and loafing about (an hour and a half), I went to get dinner with
					Robert and Kevin. We brought our orders from 7th Street Burger to their place. 7SB is a very welcome
					establishment, although their order timing is far from deterministic - Robert got his food almost 10
					minutes before Kevin and I did. It was my first chance in a good while to absolutely stuff my face
					with fast food, so I wisely got two orders of fries. At Robert and Kevin's we stared at the TV for a
					long while and then fiddled around with Robert's guitar and keyboard a little bit.
					"Wonderwall" (Rob's fave), "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" (same chords), "Hallelujah" (apparently
					Robert owes his awareness of this song song to Rufus Wainwright's rendition, and vice versa), and
					then some weeb crap. I got a carton of milk on the way home and spent an hour or so getting rid of
					old New Yorkers and maniacally breaking down that Frankensteined cardboard box (half nondescript
					cardboard, half Pampers packaging) the Portasound keyboard came in.</p>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<p>I ran a shitload of errands today. It wasn't the worst. Walked over to Ave A to grab lunch, looks like
					the restaurant that replaced Brindle Room has already been itself replaced (or completely 
					overhauled).</p>
			</ul>
			<p class="date-string">January 24 2022. Monday.</p>
			<ul>
				<p>Another day mostly devoted to getting my feet back on the ground. I'm going to get a drivers license.
					Figured out that I need to get a learners permit in this state before doing any coursework, so I
					guess I'll work on that over the coming days. The other thing I spent a bit of brainpower on is the
					new bird club - specifically, what to name it. I've already cast aside quite a few ideas, and am
					currently thinking I might label it simply "Bird Club." I don't think there's a competing generic
					bird club in the city.</p><p>
					
					With Robert out of town, it's apparent how thin my friend network here is. I had stilted
					conversations with my neighbor and the Village East Square guy today. I think I need to make a real
					effort to open myself up to social failure again, but thanks to the rona it's too easy to make
					excuses not to do anything.</p><p>
					
					On a more positive note, I had a sudden burst of inspiration regarding what to mail to PLo: a
					postcard of his nemesis, JLo. Seems so obvious in hindsight.</p><p>
					
					Just now I have a strange hankering for a ferry ride. Maybe I'll go to Staten Island tomorrow or
					something.</p>

				<p>Errands, errands... get groceries, return the company WeWork card, print checks to pay the rent, mail
					said rent, order a new HSA card, trade in my faulty modem, set up the new phone... hopefully within a
					few more days I'll feel settled. If I follow through with the driving stuff, it might take up just as
					much time. The hours have once again become difficult to allot.</p><p>
					
					Around dinnertime I walked past a large shoot of some sort on Lafayette Street, by Astor Place. I
					think the action was across the street, but on my side there were several complex arrays of lights
					and white screens set up to illuminate the facade of the building containing the Blue Man Group
					theater (and former outpost of "Culture," The Dance). It's perverse, how much work goes into getting
					something like that to look right. A few months ago I happened upon a shoot for the Sex and the City
					reboot by Madison Square Park. They did take after take of Sarah Jessica Parker and Bobby Lee
					strolling about twenty yards, and every time, three extras dressed in athleisure jogged past them and
					then jogged in place at the street crossing. I've never once seen a person jog in place at an
					intersection here - or anywhere at all, for that matter.</p><p>
					
					I've spent a good few hours on the guitar over the past couple of evenings, mostly trying to learn
					Mick Taylor's part from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kNsKCmYz5g">this live recording of
					Rocks Off</a>. I'm proud that I've been able to figure out even part of it by ear. I'm also proud of
					the immense blister that's appeared on my ring finger, which has borne the brunt of the
					slides/bends/pulloffs by far. I was still able to play through the discomfort today, but who knows what state of
					affairs tomorrow will bring. Can't remember if I ever had a blister from cello - I must've at some
					point.</p><p>
					
					Have not worked on my own music since getting back. Largely this is circumstantial but I'm
					increasingly of the mind to ask Ben to supervise my progress and keep me accountable. Shit just takes
					so long. I worry that "Popstarred" might be a lost cause with the existing backing track, but the
					thought of writing a fourth song from scratch is an even bleaker prospect at the moment. One of the
					few constants in my writing thus far has been my complete inability to write anything worthwhile on
					the guitar (in terms of words/complete song). Perhaps I should hunker down and really try writing on
					the Portasound.</p>

				<p>Bitterly cold today. I walked to the intersection Mick Jagger yaks about at the beginning of "Dance
					(Pt. 1)" - "What am I doing standing here on the corner of West 8th Street and 6th Avenue?" Well, 8th
					St becomes Greenwich Ave, so there's only two corners he could've been talking about ... and the
					storefronts at those corners are both currently unoccupied. However, I see now that they recorded
					<i>Emotional Rescue</i> at Electric Lady, which is right around the corner(s) on 8th St. Mystery
					solved. Foolish of me to embark on an excursion without checking Wikipedia first.</p><p>
					
					Anyway, I did need to get my steps in, so from 8th and 6 I looped all the way down to Tribeca. I came
					across what initially appeared to be some kind of center for promoting democracy in Hong Kong, but in
					reality was the New York branch office for a Japanese cult whose name rhymes with "Crappy Silence."
					(There was a lot of signage for praying.) I grabbed a kooky-looking pamphlet, from which my main
					takeaways thus far are
					1) there are over 500 kinds of space people, 2) Star Wars really happened (the original trilogy, at
					least), and 3) they have a new anime
					movie out - featuring a character who looks an awful lot like Stan Lee, and whose name is....</p></ul>

						<p>Maybe I should inform his estate.</p><p>
					
					I wonder if I can take any inspiration from cult marketing materials for my approach to advertising
					Bird Club. Or should it be BIRD CLUB? All caps looks nice.</p><p>
					
					Lastly, I want to note (for posterity, I guess) that today was the day I figured out that you can
					check for something extremely gross if you shine your phone flashlight in your mouth and look in a
					mirror.</p>

				<p>I got up early enough to work a little on Waiting for Mr. Right. Went to Metrograph this evening to
					see the print of <i>Sherman's March</i>. It seemed like the projector doesn't really fit in theater 2
					or something, and some of the laughter seemed a bit patronizing. But it was really nice to get to
					see something of McElwee's in theater. Don't think it's as good as <i>Bright Leaves</i> or <i>Time
					Indefinite</i>, but it's a warmer and cozier watch than either of those, very comfortably low-stakes.
					</p><p>
					
					Pretty burnt out - meant to take a 90 minute nap before the movie, ended up being more than 2 hours.
					What with the 2.5-hour long movie, I'm glad I got in a little bit of work on WFMR. Every little bit
					counts.</p>

			<ul>
				<p>It's snowing! I went out for a walk as it began to come down, and was served a frosty reminder of the
					axiom that no matter which direction I walk in this city, the wind is always blowing in my face.
					On the way back I tried to get some gin, to entertain myself while being snowed in tomorrow, but the
					stores I visited didn't have Boodles.</p><p>
					
					I can't stall for time any longer on the holiday cards for Attila and Gabor, because I ran into them
					salting the sidewalk when I got back to the building. What to write....</p><p>
					
					All in all, not much to report. The blister has gone away and my fingertips, while still sensitive,
					have that malleable, pre-callus feel. Time to catch up on sleep.</p>
