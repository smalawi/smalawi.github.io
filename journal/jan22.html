				<p>Today's my last day in Florida. I'm flying back to New York with Jenna (my sister) and Gaius (her cat)
					tomorrow. I'd meant to drop by the library to get a card (in order to stop leeching off of my dad's
					Kanopy access) but there was actual work to be done and the day slipped away. I stepped out for a
					walk around six, heading first for this grassy expanse at the edge of the property, a few leftover
					acres between the swamp and the single-family houses. It was weirdly quiet, as golden hours go -
					aside from the crickets, nothing to be heard, save for a grackle hiccuping hoarsely to itself
					somewhere in the woods. Occasionally a pale little moth would fly from my path, skittering over the
					grass, too tremulous to get more than an inch or two off the ground. I spent a little time under a
					big evergreen of some sort, checking the pinecones for seeds the birds and squirrels had missed.</p>

				<p>Flight back was uneventful (thankfully). Seems that Gaius was pretty calm from arrival at the airport
					onwards. I dozed off to the third side of Exile on Main St., slept about 40 minutes, and spent my
					subsequent wakefulness listening to the whole thing. Part of me still wishes the album just consisted 
					of eighteen Rocks Offs, but I do like it. It's got soul - plasticky, but not in the Paul Whiteman
					sense.</p><p>
					
					I was relieved to find that after five weeks my apartment smelled of nothing at all, and that no
					critters had found the not-quite-hermetically sealed cereal box on the kitchen counter. Shower faucet
					still leaks. I feel like I should figure out a belated holiday gift for Atilla and Gabor before
					inquiring about having that fixed. The mailbox was full but not overstuffed, notwithstanding the two
					Raymond Chandler paperbacks (Tom Adams covers) I'd ordered. <i>Farewell, My Lovely</i> should be
					coming during the week. After that, the remaining ones are expensive, less well-reputed, or downright
					impossible to find (<i>The Long Goodbye</i>, unfortunately).</p><p>
					
					After unpacking (ten minutes) and loafing about (an hour and a half), I went to get dinner with
					Robert and Kevin. We brought our orders from 7th Street Burger to their place. 7SB is a very welcome
					establishment, although their order timing is far from deterministic - Robert got his food almost 10
					minutes before Kevin and I did. It was my first chance in a good while to absolutely stuff my face
					with fast food, so I wisely got two orders of fries. At Robert and Kevin's we stared at the TV for a
					long while and then fiddled around with Robert's guitar and keyboard a little bit.
					"Wonderwall" (Rob's fave), "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" (same chords), "Hallelujah" (apparently
					Robert owes his awareness of this song song to Rufus Wainwright's rendition, and vice versa), and
					then some weeb crap. I got a carton of milk on the way home and spent an hour or so getting rid of
					old New Yorkers and maniacally breaking down that Frankensteined cardboard box (half nondescript
					cardboard, half Pampers packaging) the Portasound keyboard came in.</p>

				<p>I ran a shitload of errands today. It wasn't the worst. Walked over to Ave A to grab lunch, looks like
					the restaurant that replaced Brindle Room has already been itself replaced (or completely 
					overhauled).</p>
